            <h2>Description</h2>
        </header>
        <p>No flipping is needed in this family-sized baked omelet. Classic Denver stir-ins like bell pepper and ham are used here, but you could use leftover ground beef, flaked salmon, or cooked sausage. Or keep it vegetarian with whatever veggies you have on hand.</p>
        <p>My family loves omelets, and this is a quick and easy one. These directions are for a Denver omelet, but experiment with other ingredients to make your favorite.</p>
